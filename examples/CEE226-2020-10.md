# Lecture Notes: Uncertainty in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

## Introduction
- Importance of addressing uncertainty as part of the interpretation phase in the ISO 14040 series standards.
- Uncertainty is crucial when modeling future systems or systems that donâ€™t yet exist (e.g., Consequential LCA).
- Purpose of uncertainty analysis: Determine robustness of decisions made using LCA data.

## Why Address Uncertainty
- **Decision Support**: Differences in impacts can overwhelm relative differences due to large uncertainties.
- **Transparency**: Explicitly reporting uncertainties enhances the credibility of an LCA.
- **Promoting Quality**: Encourages improvement in data quality and competition among industries.
- **Information Gathering**: Prioritizes areas needing improved data and clarity.

## Sources of Uncertainty in LCA
- **Modeling Uncertainty**: Simplified models may fail to capture complex mechanisms.
- **Database Uncertainty**: Available data may not match precisely the quantities being studied.
- **Preferences**: Goal and scope definitions and analyst preferences may introduce uncertainty.
- **Future vs. Design Systems**: Design phase systems may not match actual systems due to changes or substitutions.
- **Statistical Error and Measurement**: Variability due to limited or inaccurate data collection.

## Types of Uncertainty
### Modeling Uncertainty
- Often related to unknown parameters, such as production alloy, temperatures, or processes (e.g., extrusion process).
- Model results can vary significantly based on assumed input ranges.

### Database Uncertainty
- Data may not represent exact processes, leading to use of proxies.
- Evaluate the effect of different proxies on study results.

### Preferences and System Definition
- Definition choices affect uncertainty.
- Narrower scopes (cradle-to-gate) can increase precision but decrease accuracy.
- Broader scopes increase uncertainty but may better reflect reality.

### Future vs. Design System Uncertainty
- Consequential LCAs are examples of systems not yet implemented.
- Differences between predicted impacts and actual impacts once a system is implemented.

### Statistical Error and Measurement
- Errors arise from limitations in data collection methods, temporal and spatial approximations, and proxy use.
- EcoInvent and other databases attempt to measure and classify uncertainties using statistical distributions (log normal, normal, triangular, uniform).

## Handling Uncertainty
### Sensitivity Analysis
- Aids in identifying which parts of a model contribute most to overall uncertainty.
- Tornado diagrams visualize sensitivity by showing results of changing variables one at a time.
- Focus on key variables that have the greatest effect on model outcomes to refine data.

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Uses repeated random sampling from probabilistic distributions to model overall variability and uncertainty.
- Originated from early works on probabilistic analysis.
  
### Example Applications
#### Designing an LCA Process
- Using Monte Carlo Methods on a cup manufacturing process:
  - Variations in mass, material energy, and manufacturing energy modeled as random variables.
  
#### Bridge Repair Analysis
- Monte Carlo used to assess impact categories (e.g., CO2 equivalents) for different repair strategies on a bridge.

## Reporting Uncertainty
- Use of confidence intervals (e.g., 95% confidence interval) to report uncertainty ranges.
- Comparing systems requires understanding whether differences are statistically significant.

## Conclusion
- Carry out sensitivity analysis and provide tornado diagrams as part of the interpretation phase per ISO 14040 standards.
- Uncertainty is critical in LCA and should be explicitly addressed to enhance decision-making validity and transparency.
